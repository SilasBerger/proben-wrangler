## Tools
### Split Exams PDF
Splits a class-set PDF of exam scans into individual PDFs for each student, based on a points / grade list Excel spreadsheet.

**Usage**:
```shell
python split_exams_pdf.py <path_to_clas_pdf> <path_to_metadata_spreadsheet> <spreadsheet_tab_index>
```

**Example:** The following command splits a spreadsheet `Proben_xy_korrigiert.pdf` up into individual PDFs for each student, located in `/path/to/Proben_xy_korrigiert`, using student information in worksheet / tab `0` an Excel spreadsheet `Auswertung_Probe_xy.xlsx`.

```shell
python split_exams_pdf.py "/path/to/Proben_xy_korrigiert.pdf" "/Path/to/Auswertung_Probe_xy.xlsx" 0
```

**File requirements:**
- Column `Seite` contains the 1-indexed page number on which the exam for this student begins
- Column `Name` contains the student's last name
- Column `Vorname` contains the student's first name
- Column headers are located on line 3 (1-indexed)
- PDF contains no pages to be skipped (length of the printout is calculated as a different between to starting page values in the spreadsheet)

**Example metadata file:**

| Seite | Name     | Vorname | A1 | A2  | A3  | P_total | Note |
|-------|----------|---------|----|-----|-----|---------|------|
| 1     | Muster   | Max     | 5  | 1.5 | 3   | 9.5     | 5.5  |
| 3     | Beispiel | Bettina | 7  | 1   | 3.5 | 11.5    | 6    |
| 5     | Alisson  | Alice   | 3  | 2   | 1   | 6       | 4.5  |

**Note:** The point scores and grades are not relevant for this tool. However, such a table usually exists when grading an examp, and with the addition of the _Seite_ column, it can be used as the metadata file for this PDF splitter.
